A project report by:

The code folder contains the following files:
1. Problem1.py
2. Project2_challengevideo.py
3. Project2_dataset1.py

We can run any of these codes and obtain the results posted in the video output. Sample outputs are added in the Report
Please make sure to place the dataset files in the same folder where the programs are kept.

For problem 1:
When we have 2 operable sets of codes, nested in Problem1.py. 
The first choice consists of just Gamma correction. The commented regions are for CLAHE operations, and those operations can be carried out once the comments have been removed. 
The whole code becomes compilable. We have experimented with CALHE operations as well, as they were discussed in class.

Project2_dataset1 code:
Before running the program, make sure to specify the location of the directory where the dataset images are present. 
LINE 121 contains the code where it specifies the directory for the dataset.

For example,
r"C:\Users\prade\OneDrive\Documents\UMD_Robotics\Courses\ENPM 673 - Perception\Project2\data_1-20200307T183325Z-001\data_1\data\*.png"

Copy and paste the location of the directory,
r"location_of_your_direcrtory\*.png"

Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is any problem in running the code.
