A project report by:
Pradeep Gopal
Sahana Anbazhagan
Srikumar Muralidharan

Package Dependencies/Versions I ran this code on:
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. opencv-contrib-python 4.2.0.34 
4. tflearn - version 0.3.2
5. tensorflow - version 1.14.0
6. tensorboard - version 1.14.0
7. python 3.6

The code folder contains the following files:
1. Trial_e1
2. Trial_e2
3. Trial_e15
4. catsanddogs.py

This submission has only one python file, catsanddogs.py. Make sure the training set and testing set are placed in the same folder as this code. Please change the locations to address given inside the code as per the address for your machine. If you are running the code for the first time, please make sure the first 4 lines of main are commented. Please make sure you have gpu enabled before running this code. On excecuting this code, a log folder is created and similarly, 2 files, test_set.npy and train_set.py are generated. These 2 files are further used later on in the code for validation and testing purposes on the train and test dataset. Once validation happens, checkpoints and a meta file are created, which can be saved and later loaded to use for checking against test data. Events can be further used in tensorboard to view the graphs associated with validation and loss.


Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is any problem in running the code.
