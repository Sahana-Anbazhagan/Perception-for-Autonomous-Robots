The CODE folder contains the following files:
1. data_1.csv
2. data_2.csv
3. Question2_dataset1_LS.py
4. Question2_dataset2_LS.py
5. Question2_dataset1_LS_R.py
6. Question2_dataset2_LS_R.py
7. Question2_dataset1_RANSAC.py
8. Question2_dataset2_RANSAC.py
9. Question2_dataset1_TLS.py
10. Question2_dataset2_TLS.py
11. Question3_svd.py

We can run any of these codes and obtain the graphs posted in our report. 
Please make sure to place the dataset files in the same folder where the programs are kept.

***Special note for RANSAC codes:
For both the Ransac codes, we are making sure all graphs are being plotted. As notified in our code,
if we need the final plot, we can easily comment 4 lines of code that make plots appear in each iteration.

***Special note for svd codes:
Running the code prints the U,Sigma and V matrix. 
The homography matrix is also found and verified by multilpying it with A matrix to give 0
