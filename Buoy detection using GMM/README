Buoy Detection using Gaussian mixture modelss and Expectation Maximization techniques

OS - Ubuntu 16.04/ Windows
Python version 3.6
Opencv version 4.1.2

Note: If you are using python 2, the contours function will return 3 values, so just add another variable

Example: contours3, _ = cv2.findContours(dilation1, cv2.RETR_LIST, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

	change it to,

	_,contours3, _ = cv2.findContours(dilation1, cv2.RETR_LIST, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

	For python3, the code will work fine.

There are totally 10 python files.

Run:
1) histogram_green.py to plot the histogram for green images
2) histogram_orange.py to plot the histogram for orange images
3) histogram_yellow.py to plot the histogram for yellow images

4) GMM_Green to generate the mean and standard deviation for the Green training images
5) GMM_Orange to generate the mean and standard deviation for the Orange training images
6) GMM_Yellow to generate the mean and standard deviation for the Yellow training images

Use the mean and standard deviation of 3 different gaussians obtained for the three different colours in the detection code.

7) detect_green.py to detect green buoy in the video
8) detect_orange.py to detct orange_buoy in the video
9) detect_yellow.py to detect yellow_buoy in the video
10) detect_all_buoys.py to detect all the buoys in the video.

After running detect_all_buoys.py, a video file "Buoy_detect.avi" with all buoys detected will be stored in the same directory.
